Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Setup your local Database and do database migration.
3. Once you do DB migration, run `php artisan fill ${MODEL_NAME}` this command will seed a test data for you.
4. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
5. Please follow `snake_case` naming convention for your column names.
6. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
7. Ensure the test suite passes.
8. Make sure your code lints.
9. Issue that pull request!
